# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

* A DAO is an Entity with no central Leadership
* Decisions get made from the Bottom-Up, governed by a Community organized around a specific Set of Rules enforced on a Blockchain
* These Rules result in custom Voting Power Formulas

* DAOs do not need to trust a central Entity to make sure their Investment goes through
* It is all automatic and revolves around the Rules that the DAO sets when it is created

* DAO is a Community of People with a shared Bank Account
* This shared Bank Account is called __Treasury__
* Decisions around how that Bank Account is used are made by Voting on different Proposals that Members create
* When a Proposal gets enough Votes, it is executed on the Blockchain

* A DAO is a Group of Strangers with a shared Bank Account that vote on how to use that Bank Account

## Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

* Every NFT is unique, even if they have the same Image, Name, and Properties
* An NFT with the Standard ERC-1155 can be held by multiple People

## Wallet

* A Wallet contains the Public Addresses and Private Key of a User
* Once a Wallet is connected to a Website, these Website will have Permission to call Smart Contracts on the Behalf of its User

## Agile DAO

* In Order to join the Agile DAO, the User will need a Membership NFT
* If Users do not have a Membership NFT, they can mint a Membership NFT and join the Agile DAO
* Each Member (a User that owns thw Membership NFT) will receive through an Airdrop some Governance Tokens
* A Governance Token allows Users to vote on Proposals
* Users with more Governance Token are more powerful
* Usually, Governance Token is awarded to Members of the Community who have brought the most Value

* If a Proposal has ended any Member is able to execute the proposal via the Governance Smart Contract
* Proposals can not be executed automatically, but, once a Proposal passes, any Member of the DAO can trigger the accepted Proposal

## Project Structure

* A deployed ERC-20 Token for Governance Token in the DAO
* A deployed ERC-1155 NFT that People can mint to get Membership to the DAO
* A deployed Governance Smart Contract with Treasury that contains the Logic of the DAO
* A decentralized Application that lets People:
  * connect their Wallet,
  * get an Membership NFT,
  * see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other Members and
  * vote on Proposals that are executed by the Governance Smart Contract
